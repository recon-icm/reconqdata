<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Scientometric studies report steadily increasing trend in multi-authored scientific publications. It is clearly an evidence that contemporary science requires cooperation and is not anymore a traditionally individualistic activity <span class="citation">(Moody 2004)</span>. The presented dataset comes from a study in which our overarching research goal was to understand why some scientist collaborate but some others do not. In particular, our approach was to think about <em>incentives</em> that might lead them to do so. Inspired by <span class="citation">Coleman (1994)</span> and, among others, <span class="citation">Lewis, Ross, and Holden (2012)</span> we assume that the incentives to collaborate come from academically-relevant resources the scientists possess or control and the interests they might have in resources posessed or controlled by others. For example, a theorist and an experimentalist might be interested in each other’s resources – ability to develop theoretical model of the studied problem and skills in conducting experiments respecively. Unequal distribution of these resources across academic community and the necessity of pooling them to get ahead in contemporary science result in incentives to collaborate.</p>
<p>Current state of knowledge still lacks a universally accepted behavioral understanding of the scientific process, let alone standardized tools for measuring academically-relevant resources. Hence we conducted a qualitative study among Polish scientists with the goal to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Collect egocentric data on collaborative relations.</li>
<li>Develop an inventory of academically-relevant resources from respondents’ reports.</li>
<li>Measure what resources (item 2) collaborating parties (ego and alters) engage in their collaboration ties (item 1).</li>
</ol>
<p>The data we hereby share is based on transcriptions and coding of the originally qualitative material. The study involved 40 interviews conducted on a sample of Polish scientists which we describe further in Section @ref(sample). In Section @ref(measurement) we describe the way in which the inventory of resources was constructed. A complete list with example quotes is provided in Appendix @ref(resource-inventory).</p>
</div>
<div id="sample" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#sample" class="anchor"></a>Sample</h1>
<p>Data comes from 40 Individual in-Depth Interviews (IDI) conducted between April and August 2016 by two interviewers. The quota sample consists of 20 female and 20 male scientists from six Polish cities. Respondents represented a broad range of disciplines: natural sciences, social sciences, life sciences, the humanities, engineering, and technology on different levels of career from PhD candidates to professors. The interviewees mentioned 334 collaborators in total. Interviews lasting between 24 and 90 minutes were recorded and later transcribed.</p>
</div>
<div id="measurement" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#measurement" class="anchor"></a>Measurement</h1>
<p>Each interview consisted of several parts three of which are of relevance here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Respondents were asked to name up to 10 important researchers they have collaborated with during last 5 years. Each collaborator was discussed separately giving information about gender, scientific degree, nationality, and university department (if possible). See Section @ref(nodes) below.</li>
<li>During the interview a network of collaboration among collaborators mentioned in item (1) was reconstructed using corkboard, pins, and rubber bands. See the example in Figure @ref(fig:corkboard). Corkboards were photographed and later digitized into edgelist data. See Section @ref(collaboration) below.</li>
<li>For each collaborator the respondent was asked about academically-relevant resources he/she contributed to the collaboration and what resources were contributed by the collaborator. The text of the transcripts was analyzed using QDA Miner Lite<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> in order to code resources engaged by respondents (the egos) and their collaborators (the alters) to every collaboration. The coding was performed by two persons. Random sample of the interviews was double-checked by different researchers to ensure reliability. See Section @ref(resources) below.</li>
</ol>
<p>While collaboration networks assembled from part (2) include alter-alter ties, the data on resources from part (3) was acquired for ego-alter dyads only.</p>

</div>
<div id="data-tables" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#data-tables" class="anchor"></a>Data tables</h1>
<p>The data is contained in three inter-related tables diagramatically presented in Figure @ref(fig:data-model). Below we describe each table in detail.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="data-model.png" alt="Data model."><p class="caption">Data model.</p>
</div>
<div id="nodes" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#nodes" class="anchor"></a>Node attributes</h2>
<p>The table <code>nodes</code> contains information about every person in the study – all egos and all alters. It has 374 rows and the following 7 variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>id_interview</code> – Interview identification number.</li>
<li>
<code>id_node</code> – Person identification number, unique within each interview.</li>
<li>
<code>is_ego</code> – Binary variable equal to 1 if person is the ego (respondent), 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>
<code>is_polish</code> – Binary variable equal to 1 if person is affiliated with a Polish academic institution, 0 otherwise.</li>
<li>
<code>department</code> – Marking scientists if they work at the same department. If <code>department</code> is not missing then all scientist within the same interview sharing the same value of <code>department</code> work at the same department at the same university.</li>
<li>
<code>scidegree</code> – Scientific degree of the scientist. One of <code>"mgr"</code>=MA, <code>"dr"</code>=PhD, <code>"drhab"</code>=habilitated doctor, or <code>"prof"</code>=full professor.</li>
<li>
<code>female</code> – Binary variable equal to 1 if person is female, 0 if male.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pair of variables <code>id_interview</code> and <code>id_node</code> together constitute a key uniquelly identifying each row in the <code>nodes</code> table.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#collaboration" class="anchor"></a>Collaboration networks</h2>
<p>The table <code>collaboration</code> is essentially an edge list of collaboration ties. It has 1732 rows and the following 3 variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>id_interview</code> – Interview identification number.</li>
<li>
<code>from</code> and <code>two</code> – Person identification numbers referencing the <code>id_node</code> variable from the <code>nodes</code> table.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words a row consisting of values, say, <code>id_interview=1</code>, <code>from=2</code>, <code>to=3</code> indicates that researchers 2 and 3 where reported as collaborating in the interview 1.</p>
</div>
<div id="resources" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#resources" class="anchor"></a>Resource contributions</h2>
<p>Data about resources engaged by respondents (egos) and their collaborators (alters) to every collaboration was coded based on transcripts. The data is provided in table <code>resources</code> having 1761 rows and the following 4 columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>id_interview</code> – Interview identification number.</li>
<li>
<code>from</code> and <code>two</code> – Person identification numbers (within each interview) referencing the <code>id_node</code> variable from the <code>nodes</code> table.</li>
<li>
<code>code</code> – A textual code identifying type of resource contributed by researcher <code>from</code> into the collaboration with researcher <code>to</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources engaged in collaborations (variable <code>code</code>) were coded with a coding scheme covering different elements of a research process in different disciplines. The scheme consists of 25 codes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Conceptualisation’ - Coming up with an idea for a study, providing general theoretical framework; designing a general framework for a study;</li>
<li>‘Methodology’ - Designing methodology for a study;</li>
<li>‘Investigation’ - Conducting research, gathering data;</li>
<li>‘Data analysis’ - Data analysis, quantitative as well as qualitative;</li>
<li>‘Data curation’ - Managing and archiving data;</li>
<li>‘Software creation’ - Writing software for research process;</li>
<li>‘Prototype construction’ - Building a prototype that is used in research process;</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete list of codes together with examples of coded interview fragments is presented in Appendix @ref(resource-inventory).</p>

To avoid excessive fragmentation of the coding scheme, we have decided to introduce a category that will encounter for the resources unique for particular resources across all interviews.
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Our supervisor, PhD, deals with substantial things. He doesn’t tackle any technical issues of his students or some other collaborators. He just doesn’t do it. He has more important things to do. We do it instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I bring some fresh ideas. When one has a lot of experience, she expects some things not to work out. When you don’t know that it might not work out, you have this innocence, childlikeness.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Prestige (<code>prestige</code>)</dt>
<dd>
<span class="citation">Bourdieu (1988)</span> indicated that the symbolic power was the main driver for an accumulation of different goods in academia. Some collaboration might be attractive because they are seen as prestigious.
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>He is the most recognised scientist in the world. He is well known scientist but older. He has some contacts and it helps in being pulled into the scientific world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They have a few good papers with names of those people. It just increases your chances.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Formal professional achievements (<code>professional_achievements_formal</code>)</dt>
<dd>Contemporary science has developed many forms of formal accountability, where achievements are measured according to designed indicators such as a list of publications.
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>At first I helped him. I gave him some contacts […] but at some point he did it by himself […] without my help, name and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He was aboard for long time so he also brings academic achievements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we apply for funding, he brings himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Project administration (<code>project_administration</code>)</dt>
<dd>Administrative work over a project
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>He manages a project. I smile because one has to do some paper work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We finished a project, where she was one of a leaders managing the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Proofreading (<code>proofreading</code>)</dt>
<dd>The role of written forms of knowledge was summarized by <span class="citation">Bazerman (1983)</span>. It is one of the most important activities in science <span class="citation">(Popper 1972; Merton 1973)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>So with these books, my input is proofreading.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So he tells me what he can do, what I should do, what I should correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Prototype construction (<code>prototype_construction</code>)</dt>
<dd>Building a prototype that is used in research process;
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>They are strong in design. […] in this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Software creation (<code>software_creation</code>)</dt>
<dd>Writing software for research process;
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>He was a specializt in computer stuff. Yes? All things like that, software etc. I manged to do it myself when it was relatively easy. I’m rather a loner - the majority of my work I did alone. I started collaboration before habilitation and I invited him. It was the right choice as I’ve recently learned. We were invited to take part in an international contest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He did the ‘programming machinery’. Thanks to that our system works.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Supervision (<code>supervision_in</code>)</dt>
<dd>A master-student relation is the most traditional collaboration in academia. It has a significant impact on a career in academia <span class="citation">(Wagner 2011; Zuckerman 1967)</span>.
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a supervisor of Mr. A and Ms. B.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He is my PhD student. I met him when he was a student, and then he came to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Traits of character (<code>traits_of_character</code>)</dt>
<dd>Scientific collaboration like any other teamwork is affected by collaboration skills and traits of character of all parties engaged. The literature on individual traits of character and scientific collaboration is extremely limited except some research on the role of collaborative skills in academia-industry collaboration <span class="citation">(Siegel et al. 2003)</span>. ‘Character traits’, which include different aspects of collaboration like being agreeable, reliable, or organized might be an important characteristic of a potential collaborator.
</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>She is on the one hand very responsible, she works very well. On the other hand, her work is excellent on the basis of merits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor is very communicative person. He is very friendly and his traits of character encourage collaboration.</p>
