# Introduction

Scientometric studies report steadily increasing trend in multi-authored scientific publications. It is clearly an evidence that contemporary science requires cooperation and is not anymore traditionally individualistic activity [@moody2004structure]. The presented dataset comes from a study in which our overarching research question was to understand why some scientist collaborate but some others do not. In particular, our approach was to think about *incentives* that might lead them to do so. Inspired by @coleman1994foundations and @lewis2012and we assume that incentives to collaborate come from academically-relevant resources the scientists possess or control and the interests they might have in resources posessed or controlled by others. For example, a theorist and an experimentalist might be interested in each other's resources -- ability to develop theoretical model of the studied problem and skills in conducting experiments respecively. Unequal distribution of these resources across academic community and necessity of pooling them to get ahead in contemporary science result in incentives to collaborate.

Current state of knowledge still lacks a universally accepted behavioral understanding of the scientific process, let alone standardized tools for measuring academically-relevant resources. Hence we conducted a qualitative study among Polish scientists with the goal to:

1. Collect egocentric data on collaborative relations.
2. Develop an inventory of academically-relevant resources from respondents' reports.
3. Measure what resources (item 2) collaborating parties (ego and alters) engage in their collaboration ties (item 1).

The data we hereby share is based on transcriptions and coding of the originally qualitative material. The study involved 40 interviews conducted on a sample of Polish scientists which we describe further in Section \@ref(sample). In Section \@ref(measurement) we describe the way in which the inventory of resources was constructed. A complete list with example quotes is provided in Appendix \@ref(coding-examples). 












# Sample

Data comes from `r sum(nodes$is_ego)` Individual in-Depth Interviews (IDI) conducted between April and August 2016 by two interviewers. The quota sample consists of 20 female and 20 male scientists from six Polish cities. Respondents represented a broad range of disciplines: natural sciences, social sciences, life sciences, the humanities, engineering, and technology on different levels of career from PhD candidates to professors. The interviewees mentioned `r sum(!nodes$is_ego)` collaborators in total. Interviews lasted between 24 and 90 minutes were recorded and later transcribed.
Each interview consisted of several parts three of which are of relevance here:

1. Respondents were asked to name up to 10 important researchers they have collaborating with during last 5 years. Each collaborator was discussed separately resulting with information about gender, scientific degree, nationality, and university department (if possible).
2. During the interview a network of collaboration among collaborators mentioned in (1) was reconstructed using corkboard, pins, and rubber bands. See the example in Figure \@ref(fig:corkboard). Corkboards were photographed and later digitized into edgelist data.
3. For each collaborator the respondent was asked about academically-relevant resources he/she contributed to the collaboration and what resources were contributed by the collaborator. The text of the transcripts was analyzed using QDA Miner Lite^[A product of Provalis Research, see https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/ .] in order to code resources engaged by respondents (the egos) and their collaborators (the alters) to every collaboration. The coding was performed by two persons. Random sample of the interviews was double-checked by different researchers to ensure reliability.

While collaboration networks assembled from part (2) include alter-alter ties, the data on resources from part (3) was acquired for ego-alter dyads only.



# Measurement

## Attributes

Respondents were asked to name up to 10 important collaborators during last 5 years. Each collaborator was discussed separately resulting with information about gender, scientific degree, nationality, and university department (if possible). Collected data is available in the `nodes` table described below.


## Collaboration networks

During the interview a network of collaboration among collaborators mentioned in (1) was reconstructed using corkboard, pins, and rubber bands. The corkboards were photographed and later digitized into the `collaboration` table described below.

## Resource contributions

For each collaborator the respondents were asked about academically-relevant resources he/she contributed to the collaboration and what resources were contributed by the collaborator. Interviews were audio-recorded and later transcribed. The text of the transcripts was analyzed using QDA Miner Lite^[A product of Provalis Research, see https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/ .] in order to code resources engaged by respondents (the egos) and their collaborators (the alters) to every collaboration. The coding was performed by two persons. Random sample of the interviews was double-checked by different researchers to ensure reliability. The data is available in table `resources` and described in detail below.


Data about resources engaged by respondents (egos) and their collaborators (alters) to every collaboration was coded based on transcripts. The coding was done with QDA Miner Lite software[^qda] and conducted by two persons. Random subsample of the interviews was double-checked by different researchers to ensure reliability.

[^qda]: https://provalisresearch.com/products/qualitative-data-analysis-software/

Resources engaged in collaborations were coded with a coding scheme covering different elements of a research process in different disciplines. The coding scheme consisted of the following categories:

- 'Conceptualisation' - Coming up with an idea for a study, providing general theoretical framework; designing a general framework for a study;
- 'Methodology' - Designing methodology for a study;
- 'Investigation' - Conducting research, gathering data;
- 'Data analysis' - Data analysis, quantitative as well as qualitative;
- 'Data curation' - Managing and archiving data;
- 'Software creation' - Writing software for research process;
- 'Prototype construction'  - Building a prototype that is used in research process;
- 'Knowledge' - Knowledge oriented help in research process but not falling into any of the above categories.

Coding scheme also includes different tangible and intangible resources, which might be controlled by scientists. The list of resources was built upon a literature review. 

- 'Funding acquisition' - The increasing role of ability to secure funding was underlined in many studies on contemporary science [@resnik2006price; @mirowski2011science]. 
- 'Writing' and 'Proofreading' - The role of written forms of knowledge was summarized by @bazerman1983scientific. It is one of the most important activities in science [@popper1972objective; @merton1973sociology].
- Administration - It is one of the main factors interfering with scholarship [@blau1994organization]. It can be groped into:
    + 'Project administration' - Administrative work over a project,
    + 'Formal administration' - Bureaucratic work is a result of managing complex scientific institutions. 
- 'Data' - A large part of scientific work is organised around tangible resources such as data or documents [@latour2013laboratory]. The category consist of different types of data which can be used in scientific work: qualitative, quantitative, literature reviews.
- 'Equipment' - @hagstrom1964traditional and @cetina2009epistemic indicated the crucial role of technology and scientific equipment in shaping scientific collaborations and scientific practices including centralisation of collaboration in some disciplines. 
- Contacts - The role of social contacts surrounding in the production of knowledge has been underlined in vast literature (e.g. @collins1974tea) According to literature we can group contacts into two categories
    + 'Contacts in academia' [@bellotti2012getting],
    + 'Contacts outside academia' [@powell2012open].
- 'Supervision' -  A master-student relation is the most traditional collaboration in academia. It has a significant impact on a career in academia [@wagner2011becoming; @zuckerman1967nobel].
- Position in academia
    + 'Prestige' - @bourdieu1988homo indicated that the symbolic power was the main driver for an accumulation of different goods in academia. Some collaboration might be attractive because they are seen as prestigious. 
    + 'Formal achievements' - Contemporary science has developed many forms of formal accountability, where achievements are measured according to designed indicators such as a list of publications.
- 'Character traits'- Scientific collaboration like any other teamwork is affected by collaboration skills and traits of character of all parties engaged. The literature on individual traits of character and scientific collaboration is extremely limited except some research on the role of collaborative skills in academia-industry collaboration [@siegel2003commercial]. 'Character traits', which include different aspects of collaboration like being agreeable, reliable, or organized might be an important characteristic of a potential collaborator. 
- 'Motivation' - One of character traits, which does not affect collaboration directly but is of great importance in academic setting [@gatfield2005investigation].
- 'Career development'- The studies of scientific biographies also raise questions about breakthrough moments in scientific careers. Research on contemporary Polish science indicates that for many scientists it was exposure to international science. It was usually enabled by collaborators who helped them to get international scholarships, give access to some rare data or training or wrote a recommendation letter [@marta_anatomia_2015]. 
- 'Other input' - Many scientific collaborations have a unique character. As a result, some resources are very specific to the local background. To avoid excessive fragmentation of the coding scheme, we have decided to introduce a category that will encounter for the resources unique for particular resources across all interviews. 

Several examples of coded interview fragments are presented in Appendix \@ref(appendix-coding).

# Examples of resource codes

Conceptualisation:

* We write equations together. I give him ideas. (Interview 217)

* He brings ideas. He has a lot of them and they are fascinating. (Interview 213)

Methodology:

* I have all the optical measurements from them. [...] We complement each other in research methods that are accessible in our institution. My team can do some microscopic measurements. (Interview 226)

* He gave me some tips when I was taking the measurements like what will match, how I could find something, how it will match. He also taught me one method. (Interview 214)

Investigation:

* His input is significant. I cannot collect samples without him. (Interview 211)

* I usually ask for observations, which I handle myself later on. (Interview 216)


Data analysis

* They provide me with data and I analyse it. (Interview 216)

* Sometimes I don't have time to look at charts and so forth. I collect the 'life' data and ask my colleague to compute it and to check the results. (Interview 219)

Data curation:

* She wanted me to manage the whole process from building a data set to analysing it. (Interview 212)

* I was looking for someone to get the files in order to digitalise them. The files have over 3 million records, 3 million card records so obviously she did not do it herself. (Interview 227)


Software creation: 

* He was a specializt in computer stuff. Yes? All things like that, software etc. I manged to do it myself when it was relatively easy. I'm rather a loner - the majority of my work I did alone. I started collaboration before habilitation and I invited him. It was the right choice as I've recently learned. We were invited to take part in an international contest. (Interview 220)

* He did the 'programming machinery'. Thanks to that our system works. (Interview 227)

Prototype construction:

* They are strong in design. [...] in this project. (Interview 221)


Knowledge:

* We talk, you know. Sometimes it is a brain storm. For example, if there is a call for abstract, we consult it. [I think] I don't fit in here, because I have nothing to say in this area. At least I think so. [She says:] Oh, look! Do this and this. And I will focus on something else. We meet half way. Or when we host a conference [...] I give her suggestions to analyse something. Maybe she would have interesting results. These are creative, inspiring meetings. (Interview 218)

* He is an older gentlemen with very broad knowledge about the field when it comes to methods, ideas [...] one could address. (Interview 225)


Funding acquisition:

* It was my grant and I invited them. Now it is the other way round. They have a grant and I was invited. (Interview 224)

* I paid him something. He analysed things for me. (Interview 217)


Data and other sources:

* It is appreciated to have an extensive collection of samples that could be used in experiments. I mentioned once during a conversation that I had a lot of samples, which could be utilized. (Interview 211) 

* It was material of great value that I had access to and the aspects I learned about and investigated as well. (Interview 222)

Equipment:

* So I came here, because I was needed. There was a laboratory but there was no one, who could take it over and do this kind of research. (Interview 205)

* I don't have access here to the equipment I use. I work in conditions like this, so I very much need it. (Interview 203)

Supervision:

* I am a supervisor of Mr. A and Ms. B. (Interview 209)

* He is my PhD student. I met him when he was a student, and then he came to me. (Interview 217)

Drafts:

* If he brings something intellectual, I can't see a reason why I should buy it and assume it is mine. Right? Only because I paid for it. So I added him as a co-author. (Interview 211)

* The things we prepared, the drafts... We sent them to him. (Interview 226)

Proofreading:

* So with these books, my input is proofreading. (Interview 223)

* So he tells me what he can do, what I should do, what I should correct. (Interview 214)


Contacts in academia:

* If we want to use some equipment and he knows someone who has it, he recommends us. If he wants something, I recommend him as well so he can use it. (Interview 211)

* He promised at once to give me some names, emails, and phone numbers [...] and I invited these people. (Interview 223)

* We collaborate internationally very intensively. We do visit to many places. We host people and these are really the top people in our field in the world. I think they would not get it at some other place. (Interview 224)

Contacts outside of academia:

* Thanks to her we have many contacts among practitioners. (Interview 212)

* She gives us mostly a lot of recognition in this environment and her name opens many doors. Thanks to her we found all those people, we would not have found otherwise. She was our bridge to this group. (Interview 224)

Project administration

* He manages a project. I smile because one has to do some paper work. (Interview 203)

* We finished a project, where she was one of a leaders managing the project. (Interview 209)

Formal administration:

* She is our unit leader. She initiates many projects [...]. She informs us about conferences and she encourages us to take part. She initiates research [...] (Interview 207)
 
* Professor is our boss so all financial matters. She is the unite leader. (Interview 208)
 
Motivation:

* I met him when I was finishing my master thesis. He encouraged me or motivated me to peruse academic career further. (Interview 225)

* I had a student from University A. She did her engineering diploma here. She is very gifted. During one conversation she asked what should she have done later on. I said that she could apply for Master's degree and I would be her supervisor or she could try to go abroad and [...] apply for PhDs degree. (Interview 226)

Traits of character:

* She is on the one hand very responsible, she works very well. On the other hand, her work is excellent on the basis of merits. (Interview 215)

* Professor is very communicative person. He is very friendly and his traits of character encourage collaboration. (Interview 221)

Prestige:

* He is the most recognised scientist in the world. He is well known scientist but older. He has some contacts and it helps in being pulled into the scientific world. (Interview 213)

* They have a few good papers with names of those people. It just increases your chances. (Interview 217)

Professional achievements:

* At first I helped him. I gave him some contacts [...] but at some point he did it by himself [...] without my help, name and so forth. (Interview 213)

* He was aboard for long time so he also brings academic achievements. (Interview 205)

* When we apply for funding, he brings himself. (Interview 206)


Other characteristics:

* I don't know a lot about the issue but she said that she needed someone from the other side of the country to conduct the research in companies so the results could be compared. (Interview 202)

* It was funding for Polish-German partnership. I was looking for a partner from Germany. He is interested in these issues. Since he is one of the most recognised specializts in the field, I wrote to him asking if he would be interested in this funding. (Interview 224)

Career development:

* I do a lot of things to make her my successor [...]. I see her as someone, who can take it further, better. She is the youngest in the team and with no seniority but undoubtedly she has her wits gathered and she is the best based on merits. (Interview 227)

* We had the discussion in March and I had due date in May. [He said] You know what? I will send you the syllabus. We have a statistical module at out department and I am sending you information how you can start improving your knowledge. You can learn here for free so you will not have to pay there. (Interview 212)

Other input:

* Our supervisor, PhD, deals with substantial things. He doesn't tackle any technical issues of his students or some other collaborators. He just doesn't do it. He has more important things to do. We do it instead. (Interview 230)

* I bring some fresh ideas. When one has a lot of experience, she expects some things not to work out. When you don't know that it might not work out, you have this innocence, childlikeness. (Interview 214)
