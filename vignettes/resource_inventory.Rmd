# Introduction and format

This document lists inventory of academically-relevant resource types with codes, descriptions and sample quotes. In the next section each resource is documented with:

- Its name in the title of the subsection
- Its code in parentheses
- Short textual description
- Some example quotes identified in the interviews


# Codes and quotes

```{r resinv, results="asis"}
reconqdata:::resource_inventory()
```

# Frequency distribution

Frequency distribution of types of resources. Counts correspond to number of times a particular resource appeared in entire corpus of the interviews.

```{r}
resources %>%
  count(code) %>%
  left_join(reconqdata:::codes, by="code") %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  select(
    Resource = label,
    Frequency = n
  ) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```
